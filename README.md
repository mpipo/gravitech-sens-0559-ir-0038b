Library for Gravitech's "IR Remote Control 0038B" (rehosted)

## Overview
- Product name: IR Infrared Receiver Module with Remote
- Product ID: SENS-0559
- [Product page](https://www.gravitechthai.com/product_detail.php?d=719)
- [Reference](https://www.gravitechthai.com/product_download.php?p=136)
- Distributor: Gravitech
- Manufacturer: Geeetech

## Why?
The library archive from [here](https://www.gravitechthai.com/product_detail.php?d=719) is corrupted.

I "recovered" the contents using
```
zip -F Gtech_IRremote_Library.zip
```
and am just rehosting it here in case anyone's trying to get the IR sensor to work.

The chipset "0038B" seems to be relatively undocumented, but [here's the dead link anyway](http://www.geeetech.com/ir-remote-control-0038b-module-diy-kit-p-252.html).

## License
The library is licensed under the "Lunchware" license. Don't ask me, I don't know.

The license doesn't say anything about rehosting so it's probably fine.

If for some reason you randomly come across the creator, please buy him a delicious lunch.
